# Hello there, I'm Yarema 👋

🎓 I’m a proud IT & Business Analytics student at Ukrainian Catholic University, where I’m delving into the field of technology and business to craft innovative, meaningful projects and solve real-world challenges. My journey is all about learning 📖, creating 🖌️, and pushing boundaries🤜 — whether it’s wrestling with code that just won’t work, daydreaming about the next big tech breakthrough, teaming up with classmates to turn chaos into creativity, or finding clever ways to make life (and assignments) a bit easier.
